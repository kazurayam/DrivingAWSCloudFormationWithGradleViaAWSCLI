== Overview

Build and Delivery by the toolset of
*Gradle + Shell + AWS CLI + CloudFormation* (new Gang of Four)
makes life easy for Java/Groovy/Kotlin developers.

=== Problem to solve

1. I have a few One Man projects. I want to develop Applications in Java/Kotlin. And I want to provision AWS resources for them myself. No division of labour there.
2. I want to use *https://gradle.org/[Gradle] Build Tool* to achieve
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html[Continuous Delivery].
By one command `$ gradle deploy`, I want to achieve all tasks for developing applications
in Java/Kotlin language which should run as
https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda] Functions.
3. I want to use Gradle to do compiling, testing and archiving my Java applications as usual.
4. I want to automate provisioning a https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[AWS S3] Bucket where I locate the jar file containing
my Lambda functions.
5. I want to automate uploading the jar file up to the designated S3 Bucket every after I modify the application source and rebuild it.
5. I want to automate provisioning other various AWS resources:
AWS Lambda Functions, CloudWatch Event Rules, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html[IAM Roles], Simple Queue Service,
Simple Notification Service, etc. In order to accomplish these complex tasks,
I want to use AWS Provisioning Tool https://aws.amazon.com/jp/cloudformation/[CloudFormation].

A question came up to me. _How to make full use of AWS CloudFormation functionalities in a Gradle `build.gradle` script?_

=== Solutions

I found 2 possible approaches.

1. use combination of Gradle + Shell + AWS CLI + CloudFormation. The `build.gradle` scripts calls built-in `Exec` task which executes an external shell link:../awscli-cooked.sh[`awscli-cooked.sh`] which executes https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS CLI] to drive CloudFormation.
2. use a Gradle AWS plugin https://github.com/classmethod/gradle-aws-plugin[jp.classmethod.aws]. This plugin adds a lot of custom Gradle tasks for managing various AWS resources including CloudFormation.

I did research for a few days and got a conclusion that the Gang of Four toolset is better than a single Gradle plugin.

I will explain how the Neo GOF toolset works first. Later I will also explain what I found about the plugin.

=== Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Bash shell. On Windows, I installed
https://gitforwindows.org/[Git for Windows] and got "Git Bash" bundled in it.
- AWS Account for my use
- IAM User with enough privileges.
- https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS CLI] installed and
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html[configured] on Mac or PC.
The `default` profile in `~/.aws/config` file is configured to point my privileged IAM User.
- I used Mac, though this project should work on Windows and Linux as well.

=== Project directory structure

The NeoGOF project is a Gradle Multi-project, which comprises with 5 sub-projects.

....
$NeoGOF
├─app
├─subprojectA
├─subprojectB
├─subprojectC
└─subprojectD
....

On Commandline UI, I would `cd` to the rootProject, and execute `./gradlew` command.
For example, the `hello` task of the rootProject will call each `hello` tasks defined
each sub-projects.

....
$ cd $NeoGOF
$ ./gradlew -q hello
Hello, app
Hello, subprojectA
Hello, subprojectB
Hello, subprojectB
Hello, subprojectD
Hello, rootProject
....

Or, you can execute a specific task of a subproject by typing
`:<subPorjectName>:<taskName>`.
For example;

....
$ cd $NeoGOF
$ ./gradlew -q :subprojectA:hello
Hello, subprojectA
....

=== Remarks

You can download an zip archive of the project from the https://github.com/kazurayam/NeoGOF/releases[Releases] page. Provided that you have seasoned experience of using Gradle you should be able to play on this project. If you want to try yourself, you need to know a few stuff.

==== S3 Bucket names need to be globally unique

If you are going to try running this project on your PC, there is one thing you need to edit.

In link:../gradle.properties[gradle.properties] file, you will find such line:

....
S3BucketNameA=bb4b24b08c-20200406-neogof-a
....

This line specifies the name of a AWS S3 Bucket to be provisioned. As you possibly are aware of, a S3 Bucket name must be globally unique. The example bucket name starting with `bb4b24b08c` is mine, not for your use. So you need to edit the `gradle.properties` file so that you give alternative names for your own use. I would recommend you to replace the leading `bb4b24b08c` part
with some other string.

==== One-liner to generate your identity

You want to generate your identity to make your S3 Bucket names globally unique. Ok, you can generate a mystified (possibly globally unique) 10 characters based on your AWS Account ID (12 digits) by the following shell command. Here I assume that you have AWS CLI installed:

....
$ aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account | md5sum | cut -c 1-10
....

==== *.sh files need to be executable

Another thing you need to be aware. Once cloned out, it is likely that you need to change mode of *.sh files to make them executable. I mean, you may want to do:

....
$ cd $NeoGOF
$ chmod +x ./awscli-cooked.sh
$ chmod +x ./subprojectD/awscli-cooked.sh
....
